Welcome to my Python-Projects repository! 

I have just completed the Python course and have learned so much it's mindblowing!

Django was probably the most difficult concept to grasp and learn.

Some of the projects I have completed are:

* Personal Checkbook
* Creating a dynamic website for a hotel
* Phonebook 

PERSONAL CHECKBOOK

Using Django I created a personal checkbook that kept track of deposits, withdrawals and even updated balances after transactions!

HOTEL WEBSITE

Built a website for a hotel that had a menu that you could add and delete items to.

PHONEBOOK

Using Python I built a phonebook that kept track of entries such as first and last name, phone numbers and email addresses.


Everybody says that Python is one of the most easiest types of coding there is. I completely DISAGREE! This course was extremely challenging and I found the concepts more difficult to understand and took a lot longer to catch on to than any of the others. 

BUT I DID IT!!!
